#' ChauBoxplot: Chauvenet-type boxplot
#'
#' This package provides a modified boxplot with the new fence coefficient determined by Lin et al. (2025). Specifically, the fence coefficient k=1.5 in Tukey's boxplot has been replaced by the fence coefficient associated with Chauvenet’s criterion in their formula (9). For convenience, we have also provided the chauvenet-type boxplot in both base R with function chau_boxplot(), and in ggplot2 with function geom_chau_boxplot().
