Description: Provides a modified boxplot with a new fence coefficient determined by Lin et al. (2025). The traditional fence coefficient k=1.5 in Tukey's boxplot is replaced by a coefficient based on Chauvenetâ€™s criterion, as described in their formula (9). Implementations are available in both base R with the function `chau_boxplot()`, and in ggplot2 with the function `geom_chau_boxplot()`.
